{\begin{tightemize}
\item This startup will change the world. PLEASE EMAIL IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME MONEY AND WE ARE HIRING. <3
\item Here's some Programmer Ipsum. Ethernet always wins. Syntactic sugar. Don't treat a semi colon as the end of the line, but rather as a possibility of a new beginning. Pass the array size in C. I'm moving to the bay area.

\cventry{Some Decent Startup}{The Past}

{Here's some more Programmer Ipsum. Notepad++, Sublime, Vim, Emacs, Atom, Brackets. try, catch, finally. DRY up your code. Real programmers don't document. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand. Given enough time, I can meet any software deadline.}

\cventry{Some Decent Startup}{The Past}
{Something}
{Here's even more Programmer Ipsum. C is memory with syntactic sugar. Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. Merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort, bogo sort, tim sort. How many Javascript frameworks are there? A SQL statement walks into a bar and sees two tables. It approaches, and asks 'may I join you?'}

{Something}
{If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0. When in doubt, use brute force. Deleted code is debugged code. The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. if, elsif, else, while, do-while, for. // I'll fix this later. Pass the array size in C. It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature.}
